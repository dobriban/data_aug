These are small MATLAB script used to generate the plots in Figure 1 in the supplement.

In particular:
	- mean_aug_exp.m generates the histogram, and
	- poisson_mean_aug_exp.m generates the plot of relative efficiency given different parameters lambda for the poisson distribution

To run this script without opening the GUI, check out this helpful guide: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/matlab_commandline/matlab_commandline.html.

For instance, you can run
> <path to matlab executable> -nosplash -nodisplay -nojvm -nodesktop < mean_aug_exp.m

Otherwise, you can open this file in MATLAB and run it using the GUI.
