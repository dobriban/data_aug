README

The contents of this folder are the following:

- run_all_resnet
- visualize_outputs_of_resnet_training_results.py
- aug/
- aug_flip/
- no_aug/

The run_all_resnet script is the main script to run everything, while visualize_outputs_of_resnet_training_results.py is a python script to aggregate training/test outputs into a graph. The aug/, aug_flip/, and no_aug/ directories are adaptations of https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar changing the data augmentation and supporting subsampling (to train with subsets of the full training data). 

The easiest way to run the code (with all default parameters) is to simply run the run_all_resnet script in the terminal:

> bash run_all_resnet

This should generate the results (shown in Figure 1). 

If you get import errors, make sure you have pytorch and torchvision packages installed.

> pip install torch
> pip install torchvision

For all the python files (including visualize_outputs_of_resnet_training_results.py and all the main.py files), you can run 

> python <python file name> -h 

to list the arguments you can specify (to try different inputs and such).
